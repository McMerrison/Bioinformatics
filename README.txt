Files included for each Homework problem:

Problem 1:
1. HW1.pl - Run with "perl HW1.pl" Output is two sequences, the original sequence and the mutations after 50 calls to mutate_seq. Running code will also show the pam50 matrix that is generated.
2. pam1.txt - Letters removed for simpler parsing, opened in program, do not change.

Problem 2:
1. NWAlgorithm.pdf - Solution to Problem 2

Problem 3:
1. EhtashamT_align.pl - Run with either "perl EhtashamT_align.pl [filename]" or "perl EhtashamT_align.pl -o 1 [filename]". Prints contents of input file, followed by best alignment and corresponding score. The "-o 1" flag will also give two matrices, one with the scores and one with the directional indicators: 'd', 't', 'l' and 'o' for path taken by the algorithm.
2. test_seqs.txt - Interchangeable with other files of the same format

Problem 4:
1. FindORF.pl - Run with "perl FindORF.pl". Scans hw1_sequence.txt (included) for longest 3 ORFs and prints info. 
2. HW1-BLASTReport.pdf - Reported information from BLAST search in Problem 4b.
3. hw1_sequence.txt - Heading removed for simpler parsing, opened in program, do not change.
